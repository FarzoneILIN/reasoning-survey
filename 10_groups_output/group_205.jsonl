On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.", "source_category": "abduction"}

This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.", "source_category": "abduction"}
