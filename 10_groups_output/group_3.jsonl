His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.", "source_category": "abduction"}

This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.", "source_category": "abduction"}

There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.", "source_category": "abduction"}

{"index": "lsat-rc_215", "question": "The author of passage B suggests that some laws justify the use of jury nullification because they are too", "choices": ["(A)complicated", "(B)antiquated", "(C)permissive", "(D)intrusive", "(E)general"], "answer": "E", "subject": "lsat-rc", "task_type": "multi-choice", "context": "Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.", "source_category": "abduction"}
