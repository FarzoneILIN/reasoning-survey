Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.", "source_category": "abduction"}

His twelve daughters.acted as a spur to his genius, and he looked with.Line satisfaction in the mirror each morning at the face of.a warrior going out to do battle. Nawab of course.knew that he must proliferate his sources of.revenue—the salary he received from K. K. Harouni.for tending the tube wells would not even begin to.suffice. He set up a little one-room flour mill, run off.a condemned electric motor—condemned by him..He tried his hand at fish-farming in a little pond at.the edge of his master’s fields. He bought broken.radios, fixed them, and resold them. He did not.demur even when asked to fix watches, though that.enterprise did spectacularly badly, and in fact earned.him more kicks than kudos, for no watch he took.apart ever kept time again..K. K. Harouni rarely went to his farms, but lived.mostly in Lahore. Whenever the old man visited,.Nawab would place himself night and day at the door.leading from the servants’ sitting area into the walled.grove of ancient banyan trees where the old.farmhouse stood. Grizzled, his peculiar aviator.glasses bent and smudged, Nawab tended the.household machinery, the air conditioners, water.heaters, refrigerators, and water pumps, like an.engineer tending the boilers on a foundering steamer.in an Atlantic gale. By his superhuman efforts he.almost managed to maintain K. K. Harouni in the.same mechanical cocoon, cooled and bathed and.lighted and fed, that the landowner enjoyed in.Lahore..Harouni of course became familiar with this.ubiquitous man, who not only accompanied him on.his tours of inspection, but morning and night could.be found standing on the master bed rewiring the.light fixture or in the bathroom poking at the water.heater. Finally, one evening at teatime, gauging the.psychological moment, Nawab asked if he might say.a word. The landowner, who was cheerfully filing his.nails in front of a crackling rosewood fire, told him.to go ahead..“Sir, as you know, your lands stretch from here to.the Indus, and on these lands are fully seventeen tube.wells, and to tend these seventeen tube wells there is.but one man, me, your servant. In your service I have.earned these gray hairs”—here he bowed his head to.show the gray—“and now I cannot fulfill my duties.as I should. Enough, sir, enough. I beg you, forgive.me my weakness. Better a darkened house and proud.hunger within than disgrace in the light of day..Release me, I ask you, I beg you.”.The old man, well accustomed to these sorts of.speeches, though not usually this florid, filed away at.his nails and waited for the breeze to stop..“What’s the matter, Nawabdin?”.Unauthorized copying or reuse of any part of this page is illegal. **22 CONTINUE**.“Matter, sir? O what could be the matter in your.service. I’ve eaten your salt for all my years. But sir,.on the bicycle now, with my old legs, and with the.many injuries I’ve received when heavy machinery.fell on me—I cannot any longer bicycle about like a.bridegroom from farm to farm, as I could when I.first had the good fortune to enter your employment..I beg you, sir, let me go.”.“And what’s the solution?” asked Harouni, seeing.that they had come to the crux. He didn’t particularly.care one way or the other, except that it touched on.his comfort—a matter of great interest to him..“Well, sir, if I had a motorcycle, then I could.somehow limp along, at least until I train up some.younger man.”.The crops that year had been good, Harouni felt.expansive in front of the fire, and so, much to the.disgust of the farm managers, Nawab received a.brand-new motorcycle, a Honda 70. He even.managed to extract an allowance for gasoline..The motorcycle increased his status, gave him.weight, so that people began calling him “Uncle,” and.asking his opinion on world affairs, about which he.knew absolutely nothing. He could now range.further, doing a much wider business. Best of all,.now he could spend every night with his wife, who.had begged to live not on the farm but near her.family in Firoza, where also they could educate at.least the two eldest daughters. A long straight road.ran from the canal headworks near Firoza all the way.to the Indus, through the heart of the K. K. Harouni.lands. Nawab would fly down this road on his new.machine, with bags and cloths hanging from every.knob and brace, so that the bike, when he hit a bump,.seemed to be flapping numerous small vestigial.wings; and with his grinning face, as he rolled up to.whichever tube well needed servicing, with his ears.almost blown off, he shone with the speed of his.arrival.", "source_category": "abduction"}

A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went \"against all previous experiences of nuclear physics,\" but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term \"nuclear fission,\" she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.", "source_category": "induction"}
